# Library Management (Training Project)

This is a training project for learning **classes** and using the **`json`** and **`os`** libraries in Python.  
With this program, you can add books, return them, borrow them, and view the complete library list.  
All book data is stored in a JSON file so the information remains even after closing the program.

*The goal of this project is to practice and better understand file handling, classes, and data management in Python.*
