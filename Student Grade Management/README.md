# Student Grade Manager (SGM)

This project is designed for learning comparison operators in Python.  
It also uses concepts from previous lessons to build a simple student grade management system.

For better readability and maintainability, type hints have been used throughout the code.

Additionally, in this project, we learned how to handle terminal input as a menu-driven (dropdown-like) selection, allowing users to choose options by entering numbers.

Feel free to explore and extend the project!
