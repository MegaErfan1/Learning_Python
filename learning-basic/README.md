# Learning_Python
This repository contains my basic Python practice code.

I'm learning Python from scratch, and here I share my small exercises and beginner projects to track my progress.

Each folder includes a specific topic (like variables, loops, functions, etc.) and simple examples.

Thanks for visiting!
